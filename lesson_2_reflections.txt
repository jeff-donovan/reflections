1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Your current directory becomes a repository. Now we can make new commits and run
git commands on that repository.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a subset of the working directory and the repository. It
allows you to group (or circle) the files you want to commit.


3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

You can first use 'git status' to check the status of your staging area. It will
show how many files are in the staging area. Then you can use 'git diff' (no
input parameters) to see the difference between the staging area and the working
directory. You can also use 'git diff --staged' to check the difference between
the staging area and the most recent commit.


4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Let's say you want to add new functionality to your code. If you can think of
multiple ways to add that functionality it makes sense to try each approach to
see which one is best. You can also A/B test features in a similar way.
