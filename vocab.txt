ERRORS AND WARNINGS:

Should not be doing an octopus
	- Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code
	together. This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an
	inappropriate situation.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state
	- HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach”
	the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next
	video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach
	the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.

Panic! (the 'impossible' happened)
	- This is a real error message, but it’s not output by Git. Instead it’s
	output by GHC, the compiler for a programming language called Haskell. It’s
	reserved for particularly surprising errors!
