1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Your current directory becomes a repository. Now we can make new commits and run
git commands on that repository.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a subset of the working directory and the repository. It
allows you to group (or circle) the files you want to commit.
